# SDSL v3 - Succinct Data Structure Library (fork)

This is a fork of the sdsl-lite header-only library, which is a C++ library for succinct data structures. The original library can be found at this [link](https://github.com/xxsds/sdsl-lite).

This fork adapts the Elias-Fano data structure for its use in [Grafite](https://github.com/marcocosta97/grafite).
